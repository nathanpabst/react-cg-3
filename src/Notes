Section 33. writing more complex JSX code
    You can only have one single root element per return statement/JSX code snippet.
    Workaround...create one div element to contain any additional elements that you need. 


Section 32. building a first custom component
    A component, in React, is merely a JavaScript function. 
    Always use the following steps...
    1. Create a component (folder, file, and function)
    2. Export the component
    3. Import the component in the file where you want to use it. e.g. App.js 

Section 31. How React Works
    React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML & JavaScript (and CSS)
    With React, we are building our own custom HTML elements. React is all about components 
    (which are custom HTML elements) and is accomplished using a declarative approach 
    i.e. we define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JS DOM instructions. 
    (rather than an imperative approach...how it is done with JS...clear step by step instructions). 

Section 30. Introducing JSX
    JSX (JavaScript XML) is essentially HTML code inside of JavaScript. 

Section 29. Analyzing a standard React Project
    SRC is where all React code (ultimately this code is all JavaScript) will be written. 
    A transformed version of the code in the index.js file is the first to be executed 
    when the SPA is loaded (via the 'npm run start' command). This 'transformed' version is done 
    behind the scenes by scripts that transform and optimize the code. The 'npm run start' command
    (a.k.a. the development server: local host) watches the 'root' directs to the index.html file 
    found within the public folder. The App.js file is a component. In order to render/use the App.js 
    component, we must export the file in App.js and import it in this file (index.js) or the file in 
    which you plan to use the code. The index.html file takes instruction from the index.js file. The
    render method within index.js instructs the .html file to display the <App /> component in the 'root' div.
