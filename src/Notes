_______Section 4 notes: React State & Working with Events__________

Module 48. Working with State...
    To prompt react to re-render/re-evaluate a component, we import the 'useState' function which is 
    provided by the react library. EX. import React, {useState} from 'react'; --a.k.a. a react hook
    All react hooks start with the prefix 'use...' and must be called within the component function 
    (NOTE...hooks should not be used within nested functions). the useState function allows the component 
    to be called again and to assign values as 'state', when we call the function. useState returns an 
    array containing the variable/value and an updating function. We use array destructing to accomplish this.
    EX. const [title, setTitle] = useState(props.title) --order matters here...'title' is the managed value 
    the second element is a function that we use to set the updated state value 


Module 47. How Component Functions are Executed...
    Components are regular functions that return JSX. Functions must be called. We use these functions
    like HTML elements in the JSX code. Using a component, within the return statement, is similar to a 
    function call. By using components in JSX code, we make react aware of the component functions. when
    react evaluates the JSX code it will call each component function and evaluate its JSX code until all 
    of the code has been called/evaluated. It then react evaluates the overall result and translates it to 
    DOM instructions which then render on the screen. 
    React starts with the index.js file (reactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root')))
    This is all done when the application is initially rendered...it doesn't repeat itself. In order to update
    or re-render a component, we use the concept of 'State'.

Section 43. Alternative Function Syntax (arrow functions)...
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
EX. syntax: const App = () => {}
Section 39. The concept of Composition ('children props')...
    About combining components & extracting HTML/JSX code. For example, creating a wrapper component
    i.e. Card that can be used often to reduce code & style duplication and keep components clean.
    the building blocks that make up a UI 

Assignment One...
Expenses...
1. Create a new component, in the components folder, called Expenses that will be responsible for displaying our expenses
2. export the Expenses function
3. write a function called Expenses containing a root JSX element (div) in the return statement
4. import the ExpenseItems component 
5. paste the ExpenseItems self-closing components from App.js into the div
6. add props to the Expenses function to make the expense item properties from App.js available   
7. import the Expenses.css file & add a className to the root element 
App.js...
1. import the Expenses component
2. remove the ExpenseItems import statement
3. delete the ExpenseItems self-closing components from App.js (this was moved into the root JSX element of the Expenses component.   
4. forward the props from App.js to the Expenses component by adding a self-closing Expenses component within the root element of App.js
    Expenses should include an 'items' prop pointing to the const 'expenses' array

Section 36. passing data via props
    components can be truly re-usable and configurable by using the concept of 'props'. (shorthand for properties)
    i.e. passing data from one component to another.   

Section 33. writing more complex JSX code
    You can only have one single root element per return statement/JSX code snippet.
    Workaround...create one div element to contain any additional elements that you need. 


Section 32. building a first custom component
    A component, in React, is merely a JavaScript function. 
    Always use the following steps...
    1. Create a component (folder, file, and function)
    2. Export the component
    3. Import the component in the file where you want to use it. e.g. App.js 

Section 31. How React Works
    React allows you to create re-usable and reactive components consisting of HTML & JavaScript (and CSS)
    With React, we are building our own custom HTML elements. React is all about components 
    (which are custom HTML elements) and is accomplished using a declarative approach 
    i.e. we define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the actual JS DOM instructions. 
    (rather than an imperative approach...how it is done with JS...clear step by step instructions). 

Section 30. Introducing JSX
    JSX (JavaScript XML) is essentially HTML code inside of JavaScript. 

Section 29. Analyzing a standard React Project
    SRC is where all React code (ultimately this code is all JavaScript) will be written. 
    A transformed version of the code in the index.js file is the first to be executed 
    when the SPA is loaded (via the 'npm run start' command). This 'transformed' version is done 
    behind the scenes by scripts that transform and optimize the code. The 'npm run start' command
    (a.k.a. the development server: local host) watches the 'root' directs to the index.html file 
    found within the public folder. The App.js file is a component. In order to render/use the App.js 
    component, we must export the file in App.js and import it in this file (index.js) or the file in 
    which you plan to use the code. The index.html file takes instruction from the index.js file. The
    render method within index.js instructs the .html file to display the <App /> component in the 'root' div.
